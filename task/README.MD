# `task` -- Task parallel workflow

## Dependencies package

- [Ants](https://github.com/panjf2000/ants) - Library ants implements a goroutine pool with fixed capacity, managing and recycling a massive number of goroutines, allowing developers to limit the number of goroutines in your concurrent programs.

- [sync.WaitGroup](https://pkg.go.dev/sync) - Package sync provides basic synchronization primitives such as mutual exclusion locks. Other than the Once and WaitGroup types, most are intended for use by low-level library routines. Higher-level synchronization is better done via channels and communication.  
Values containing the types defined in this package should not be copied.
